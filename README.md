# GA-ICM-CONSENSUS

experiments with genetic algorithms.

Tried adding ICM to GA training https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05363.pdf  
Tried adding a consensus operator that works as a crossover or mutation during GA fitting.
Crossover operator from http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13354
(Also tried binarized nn but could not have decent results)
Looked at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06567.pdf
Using Ray to have parallel simulation on gym envs.

This is a backup, the code will be outdated.
