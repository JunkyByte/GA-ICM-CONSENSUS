# GA-ICM-CONSENSUS

> Results on CarRacing env, a cautious but certainly drunk driver!

Some of my experiments with genetic algorithms.
Tried adding ICM to GA training https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05363.pdf  
Tried adding a consensus operator that works as a crossover or mutation during GA fitting.  
Crossover operator from http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13354

(Also tried binarized nn but results were bad)
Looked at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06567.pdf  
Using Ray to have parallel simulation on gym envs.

This code was written for fun and should not be taken as an example.
