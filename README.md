# GA-ICM-CONSENSUS

experiments with genetic algorithms.

Tried adding ICM to GA training https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05363.pdf  
Tried adding a consensus operator that works as a crossover or mutation during GA fitting.  
Using Ray to have parallel simulation on gym envs.

This is a backup, the code will be outdated.
